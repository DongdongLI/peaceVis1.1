We use D3.js to visualize the arm-conflict and economics data of all countries.
=====================
data folder: includes all the raw data and result of procession
js folder: includes js code for the visualizations
=====================
MY CONTRIBUTION: 
1.I used python to process raw data of war and economy and generated JSON files which are more easily to be used.
2.I am responsible for the trend line of the change of unemployment and the bar chart describing war level of a country from year
  to year.
  
  They are in the bottom of the index page. (source code: js/timeSeries_warLevel.js   js/timeSeries_unemployment.js)
